# ChronoSort
## Overview
[text](results/figure_1/New_figure_1.pdf)
ChronoSort is a computational framework designed to extract dynamic conformational information from protein ensembles generated by AlphaFold3. Using a novel algorithm, ChronoSort analyzes structural variations within these ensembles and correlates them with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This approach enables researchers to identify and characterize functionally relevant conformational states, bridging the gap between static structure predictions and dynamic behavior observed in MD trajectories. ChronoSort facilitates deeper insights into protein flexibility, mechanisms, and potential functional transitions by integrating predictive models with simulation data.

## üìÅ Project Layout

The repository is structured into six main folders:

| Folder             | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `source/`          | Contains example protein ensembles, in both cif and pdb format, for 5IBO, 1EX9, 4AKE, and 1ONC.   |
| `scripts/`         | Scripts for running ChronoSort on new datasets. More detailed info is contained in the README within this folder. Also contains data to test scripts and dependencies.          |
| `data/`            | Output files from running chronosort with the following proteins: 5IBO, 1EX9, 4AKE and 1ONC. MD Simulation data for the same proteins is available upon request from the authors.  |
| `output/`          | Example output files. Generated from running the pca_analysis.py script on the sequences in the scripts/test_data/ folder.   |
| `results/`         | Figures from author's publication: "ChronoSort: Revealing Hidden Dynamics in AlphaFold3 Structure Prediction." Code for figures is also included.        |
| `miscellaneous/`   | Micellaneous files, primarily for MD parameterization. Code not part of the main pipeline.    |
