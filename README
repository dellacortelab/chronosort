# ChronoSort
## Overview
ChronoSort is a computational framework designed to extract dynamic conformational information from protein ensembles generated by AlphaFold3. Using a novel algorithm, ChronoSort analyzes structural variations within these ensembles and correlates them with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This approach enables researchers to identify and characterize functionally relevant conformational states, bridging the gap between static structure predictions and dynamic behavior observed in MD trajectories. ChronoSort facilitates deeper insights into protein flexibility, mechanisms, and potential functional transitions by integrating predictive models with simulation data.
